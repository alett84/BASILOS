For some modules, you will have to write at least some portion of your code in assembly. You should not require more than those instructions listed here.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily call $\ast$address$\ast$} ~\newline
 Calls {\itshape address} as a function. {\itshape Address} needs to be either a label in the current assembly source file, or an identifier marked {\ttfamily extern} in the current assembly source file. The return address will automatically be pushed on to the stack.
\item {\ttfamily cli} ~\newline
 Disable interrupts. No further interrupts will be handled until they are reenabled with {\ttfamily sti}.
\item {\ttfamily in $\ast$dest$\ast$, $\ast$src$\ast$} ~\newline
 Read one, two, or four bytes from the I/O address {\itshape src}, saving it to the register {\itshape dest}. {\itshape Dest} must be one of the registers {\ttfamily AL} (read one byte), {\ttfamily AX} (two bytes), or {\ttfamily EAX} (four bytes). {\itshape Src} must be a literal value or the register {\ttfamily DX}.
\item {\ttfamily iret} ~\newline
 Return from an Interrupt Service Routine. The CPU will pop the return address, CS, and EFLAGS from the stack.
\item {\ttfamily mov $\ast$dest$\ast$, $\ast$src$\ast$} ~\newline
 Copy the value from {\itshape src}, which may be a register, memory location, or literal value, to {\itshape dest}, which may be a register or memory location.
\item {\ttfamily out $\ast$dest$\ast$, $\ast$src$\ast$} ~\newline
 Write one, two, or four bytes from {\itshape src} to the I/O address {\itshape dest}. {\itshape Dest} must be a literal value or the register {\ttfamily DX}. {\itshape Src} must be one of the registers {\ttfamily AL} (write one byte), {\ttfamily AX} (two bytes), or {\ttfamily EAX} (four bytes).
\item {\ttfamily pop $\ast$dest$\ast$} ~\newline
 Pop the bottom value of the stack into the register {\itshape dest} and increment the stack pointer by 4 bytes.
\item {\ttfamily popa} ~\newline
 Pop all general purpose registers from the stack and increment the stack pointer the appropriate amount.
\item {\ttfamily push $\ast$src$\ast$} ~\newline
 Decrement the stack pointer by 4 bytes and push the contents of the register or literal value {\itshape src} onto the stack.
\item {\ttfamily pusha} ~\newline
 Push all the general purpose registers from the stack and decrement the stack pointer by the appropriate amount.
\item {\ttfamily ret} ~\newline
 Return from an ordinary (non-\/\+ISR) function. The CPU will pop the return address from the stack.
\item {\ttfamily sti} ~\newline
 Enable interrupts.

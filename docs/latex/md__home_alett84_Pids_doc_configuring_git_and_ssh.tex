We will use Git to interact with Git\+Hub for managing source code. Git relies on SSH for secure communications with remote servers, so we\textquotesingle{}ll set that up first.\hypertarget{md__home_alett84_Pids_doc_configuring_git_and_ssh_autotoc_md20}{}\doxysection{Configuring SSH}\label{md__home_alett84_Pids_doc_configuring_git_and_ssh_autotoc_md20}

Git\+Hub requires SSH to be authenticated using a key. If you already have an SSH key, you can go to the following step. Otherwise, generate a new key by running\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}ssh-keygen
\end{DoxyVerb}
 You are strongly suggested to use the default file name. If you specify a different file name for your key, you are on your own for configuring Git and SSH to use that key.

You can use a passphrase on your key for additional security, or leave it blank. Just make sure it\textquotesingle{}s something you can remember if you do set a passphrase.

Pay particular attention the line of output beginning with {\ttfamily Your public key has been saved in}. You will need the file name that comes after in the next step.\hypertarget{md__home_alett84_Pids_doc_configuring_git_and_ssh_autotoc_md22}{}\doxysubsection{Adding your public key to Git\+Hub}\label{md__home_alett84_Pids_doc_configuring_git_and_ssh_autotoc_md22}
Display the contents of your public key (if you used the default file name, the following should work)\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
\end{DoxyVerb}
 In a browser, login to Git\+Hub. In the upper right, click your user icon, then select Settings from the drop-\/down menu. On the left side of the screen, select \char`\"{}\+SSH and GPG keys\char`\"{}. Click the \char`\"{}\+New SSH key\char`\"{} button. Copy your public key (the output of the {\ttfamily cat} command) and paste it in the \char`\"{}\+Key\char`\"{} box. Finally, click \char`\"{}\+Add SSH key\char`\"{}.\hypertarget{md__home_alett84_Pids_doc_configuring_git_and_ssh_autotoc_md23}{}\doxysection{Configuring Git}\label{md__home_alett84_Pids_doc_configuring_git_and_ssh_autotoc_md23}
With SSH set up, Git should be ready to communicate with Git\+Hub. However, you still need to configure Git with your name and email address to make sure you get proper credit for your contributions. Simply run\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "Your Email Address"
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Obviously, replace {\itshape Your Name} and {\itshape Your Email Address} with your actual name and email address, but make sure you leave the quotes.

Windows is not suited for native MPX development. Instead, you will need to set up a Linux distribution in a either virtual machine or using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).\hypertarget{md__home_alett84_Pids_doc_setup_autotoc_md25}{}\doxysection{Virtual Machine}\label{md__home_alett84_Pids_doc_setup_autotoc_md25}
The recommended virtual machine is LOUD, the LCSEE Optimized Ubuntu Distribution. Follow the directions at \href{https://lcseesystems.wvu.edu/services/loud}{\texttt{ https\+://lcseesystems.\+wvu.\+edu/services/loud}}. If you encounter issues where the virtual machine hangs at a black screen, or is unusably slow (indicated by a turtle icon in the bottom-\/right hand corner of the Virtual\+Box window), consider WSL instead.\hypertarget{md__home_alett84_Pids_doc_setup_autotoc_md26}{}\doxysection{WSL}\label{md__home_alett84_Pids_doc_setup_autotoc_md26}
WSL is an optional component of Windows 10 and later. First, you will need to ensure that WSL itself is enabled, and that a distribution is installed. Open an elevated Command Prompt or Power\+Shell window by pressing the Windows Key + X, and choosing \char`\"{}\+Command Prompt (\+Admin)\char`\"{} or \char`\"{}\+Power\+Shell (\+Admin)\char`\"{}. In this window, run\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}wsl --install -d ubuntu
\end{DoxyVerb}
 This will enable WSL if it isn\textquotesingle{}t already, and install Ubuntu along with it. If WSL wasn\textquotesingle{}t already installed, you may need to reboot before you can launch an Ubuntu window. The first time you open an Ubuntu window, you\textquotesingle{}ll be prompted to create a username and password. This will become the local account within the Ubuntu environment, and the password will become the one you need later to run commands with {\ttfamily sudo}. Once the account is set up, follow the steps for Ubuntu below.\hypertarget{md__home_alett84_Pids_doc_setup_autotoc_md27}{}\doxysection{Preparing Ubuntu and Other Debian Derivatives for MPX Development}\label{md__home_alett84_Pids_doc_setup_autotoc_md27}
Ubuntu is the primary development environment for MPX and the basis for LOUD, so no extensive preparation is needed. Simply open a terminal window and run the following commands\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y clang make nasm git binutils-i686-linux-gnu qemu-system-x86 gdb
\end{DoxyVerb}
\hypertarget{md__home_alett84_Pids_doc_setup_autotoc_md28}{}\doxysection{Preparing mac\+OS for MPX Development}\label{md__home_alett84_Pids_doc_setup_autotoc_md28}
All commands need to be run from a Terminal. You should be able to find the Terminal application in the {\ttfamily /\+Applications} folder of your system\textquotesingle{}s internal disk. Alternatively, pressing Command+\+Space and typing {\ttfamily Terminal} should bring it up.\hypertarget{md__home_alett84_Pids_doc_setup_autotoc_md29}{}\doxysubsection{Install XCode Tools}\label{md__home_alett84_Pids_doc_setup_autotoc_md29}
First, you need to install the XCode development tools. This includes the compiler, clang, and GNU make. This command will open a pop-\/up window for confirmation. Once confirmed, this may take some time to complete. \begin{DoxyVerb}xcode-select --install
\end{DoxyVerb}
 \hypertarget{md__home_alett84_Pids_doc_setup_autotoc_md30}{}\doxysubsection{Install Homebrew}\label{md__home_alett84_Pids_doc_setup_autotoc_md30}
Next, install the Homebrew package manager from \href{https://brew.sh}{\texttt{ https\+://brew.\+sh}}. There should be a command under the label \char`\"{}\+Install Homebrew\char`\"{} that you can copy and paste into your Terminal window. Note that this makes use of the XCode tools installed in the first step, so that {\bfseries{must}} be complete prior to this step.

It is likely that installing Homebrew will prompt you for your password so that it can elevate privileges using {\ttfamily sudo}. This is the same password you use to unlock your account when you turn on your system.

Note also that once the command you paste from the web site completes, there are a few additional steps you need to take to finalize the installation of Homebrew. In your terminal window, there will be some output beginning with the bold words $\ast$$\ast${\ttfamily ==$>$ Next steps\+:}$\ast$$\ast$. You must follow the instructions in your Terminal window to complete the Homebrew installation.\hypertarget{md__home_alett84_Pids_doc_setup_autotoc_md31}{}\doxysubsection{Install Remaining Tools}\label{md__home_alett84_Pids_doc_setup_autotoc_md31}
Once Homebrew is installed, you can easily install NASM, QEMU, the cross-\/linker, and cross-\/debugger. \begin{DoxyVerb}brew install nasm qemu i686-elf-binutils i386-elf-gdb
\end{DoxyVerb}
 If you get an error here, make sure that you followed the $\ast$$\ast${\ttfamily ==$>$ Next steps\+:}$\ast$$\ast$ portion of the Homebrew installation process. You may need to open a new Terminal window for the changes to take effect.
